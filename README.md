# Advanced-NLP-Based-Amazon-Reviews-Analytics
Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) project on Sentiment Analysis and Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) on Amazon Reviews

# Introduction
The goal of this project is to design and implement an advanced analytics engine based on Natural 
Language Processing methodologies. The system is intended to automatically parse, dissect, and 
assimilate customer feedback from Amazon reviews. Its primary goal is to distill sentiment trajectories, 
uncover actionable insights, and group feedback into thematic buckets for each category of products, 
enabling businesses to improve product offerings, raise customer service standards, and increase overall 
consumer satisfaction.
Our goal is to create a dependable, scalable system that employs a sophisticated merger of NLP 
techniques, including tokenization, lemmatization, sentiment scoring, and thematic modeling, as well as 
advanced technologies like TF-IDF, word embeddings, LSTM networks, and BERT models. This 
combination intends to extract nuanced insights and identify significant sentiment trends and thematic 
categorizations from unstructured text, providing businesses with granular, actionable data.
Furthermore, our project includes an Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis module to further enhance its 
utility and impact. This module delves deeper than the general sentiment by analyzing the sentiment 
towards particular features e.g., the battery life of electronics, that people discuss about products in 
each category. Businesses can use this to determine which features are popular, valued, and in need of 
improvement.

# Data Information
## Dataset Introduction:
The Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset serves as the source of the primary training dataset for the NLP
based Amazon Review Analytics System. This dataset is curated to facilitate deep Natural Language 
Processing and sentiment analysis studies, and it includes a large number of product reviews from 
various categories. Its primary purpose is to provide a diverse and robust dataset for training and 
testing our NLP models, thus ensuring high accuracy and reliability in sentiment analysis.

# Model Development and Selection
To optimize the accuracy and efficiency of our analytics engine, two models were developed:

1. BERT-based Sentiment Analysis Model (`bert_sentiment_model.pth`)
2. LSTM-based Sentiment Analysis Model (`model.h5`)

The LSTM-based model showed superior performance in capturing the context and nuances of customer sentiment and was thus chosen for production deployment.

### Deployment Details
The LSTM model (`model.h5`) is integrated into a Streamlit web application for local deployment. This approach allows users to interact with the model directly on their local machines, providing a more accessible and customizable user experience.

The deployment process includes:

1. Setting up a virtual environment and installing necessary packages including Streamlit.
2. Writing a Streamlit script (`app.py`) that uses the LSTM model to process input and display sentiment analysis results.
3. Running the Streamlit app locally by executing `streamlit run app.py` in the command line, which launches the app in a web browser for interactive use.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
Although the main deployment is local, CI/CD pipelines are configured to automate the testing and updating of the application script. Upon a new commit to the main branch in the GitHub repository, the CI pipeline runs tests to validate the integrity of the code. This ensures that the Streamlit application remains robust and error-free.

### Monitoring and Observability
For local deployment, basic monitoring is facilitated through logs generated by the Streamlit application, which can help track the application's performance and troubleshoot any issues.

## Conclusion
The integration of MLflow, TensorFlow, Vertex AI, and Docker encapsulates our commitment to robust MLOps practices. With a single LSTM-based model deployed out of the two trained, we maintain a focus on quality and performance, ensuring that the Advanced NLP-Based Amazon Reviews Analytics system remains at the forefront of sentiment analysis applications.
