Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.

Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in.

Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,favoritetrainingandwalkingaroundsneakerstheylookgoodwithjustaboutanythingandarecomfortableformostsituationswiththeexceptionofrunningforwhichiusepropermizunorunningsneakerswithanarchsupportinsolethesesneakersaremygotoificouldidtakeawayastarforarchsupportihaveaslightlywiderfrontofthefootandarchesthatarealittleonthehighsidesoidolookforagoodunderthefootfiticouldprobablytiethelacesdifferentlyorputinaninsoletheyreprettyexpensivebutasiswhenididazumbaclassinthesemyarchbegantotwingehoweverthisisoverallanawesomeshoethatiwillcontinuetostickwithforgoingoutdaytodaywalkingandfortrainingandgymusewiththeexceptionofrunningandzumbaalthoughhiphopwasfinetheshoeshaveagreatflexibilitytothemanddontlookdirtyeasilymypreviouspairofflexsupremetrshavelastedforagoodyearsandarejustnowonthevergeofbeingwornoutthisistheoptimalsneakerthatisflexibleinmorewaysthanonefrompointingyoutoestolegpressingfromgymusetoshoppingtoaddingasportyedgetoadressynightouttheflexhasitall

I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.

They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running. But this also makes them extremely comfortable, I hadn't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these. Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in. But if you mainly take cardio classes and/or do weight training or just need something to wear around town look no further.","Very comfortable, cute, and long-lasting",1515369600,ilovetheseihadthepreviousiterationormaybetwoearlierandfinallyworethemoutafterseveralyearstheyaredefinitelyalightweighttrainingshoesoiwouldntgetthemifyouaregoingtobedoingalotofrunningbutthisalsomakesthemextremelycomfortableihadntrealizedhowhotrunningshoesmademyfeetuntiliswitchedtothesegoodsupportandmyfeetstaycoolalldayalsonoticeablylightbutwellmadeandlonglastingihavewornthemhikinginapinchbutdontreallyrecommenditbecausethematerialismeshlikeandwillletalotofdirtinbutifyoumainlytakecardioclassesandordoweighttrainingorjustneedsomethingtoweararoundtownlooknofurther

I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,favoritetrainingandwalkingaroundsneakerstheylookgoodwithjustaboutanythingandarecomfortableformostsituationswiththeexceptionofrunningforwhichiusepropermizunorunningsneakerswithanarchsupportinsolethesesneakersaremygotoificouldidtakeawayastarforarchsupportihaveaslightlywiderfrontofthefootandarchesthatarealittleonthehighsidesoidolookforagoodunderthefootfiticouldprobablytiethelacesdifferentlyorputinaninsoletheyreprettyexpensivebutasiswhenididazumbaclassinthesemyarchbegantotwingehoweverthisisoverallanawesomeshoethatiwillcontinuetostickwithforgoingoutdaytodaywalkingandfortrainingandgymusewiththeexceptionofrunningandzumbaalthoughhiphopwasfinetheshoeshaveagreatflexibilitytothemanddontlookdirtyeasilymypreviouspairofflexsupremetrshavelastedforagoodyearsandarejustnowonthevergeofbeingwornoutthisistheoptimalsneakerthatisflexibleinmorewaysthanonefrompointingyoutoestolegpressingfromgymusetoshoppingtoaddingasportyedgetoadressynightouttheflexhasitall

I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them.

I've had Nike's before and have always been pleased with the comfort, performance, and quality. Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).

I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,favoritetrainingandwalkingaroundsneakerstheylookgoodwithjustaboutanythingandarecomfortableformostsituationswiththeexceptionofrunningforwhichiusepropermizunorunningsneakerswithanarchsupportinsolethesesneakersaremygotoificouldidtakeawayastarforarchsupportihaveaslightlywiderfrontofthefootandarchesthatarealittleonthehighsidesoidolookforagoodunderthefootfiticouldprobablytiethelacesdifferentlyorputinaninsoletheyreprettyexpensivebutasiswhenididazumbaclassinthesemyarchbegantotwingehoweverthisisoverallanawesomeshoethatiwillcontinuetostickwithforgoingoutdaytodaywalkingandfortrainingandgymusewiththeexceptionofrunningandzumbaalthoughhiphopwasfinetheshoeshaveagreatflexibilitytothemanddontlookdirtyeasilymypreviouspairofflexsupremetrshavelastedforagoodyearsandarejustnowonthevergeofbeingwornoutthisistheoptimalsneakerthatisflexibleinmorewaysthanonefrompointingyoutoestolegpressingfromgymusetoshoppingtoaddingasportyedgetoadressynightouttheflexhasitall

I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",Comfortable and lightweight,1462320000,iamarecessaideandonmyfeetalldaylongitriedtheseshoesoninthestorebeforepurchasingthemonamazontheyareverylightweightandcomfortableiwassurprisedhowgreattheyfeltihaventhadapairofnikessincenikeshoxscameouttheyaresomuchmorelightweightthanthoseiworethemanentiredaythefirstdayandhadnoproblemstheseconddayhoweverigotapaininmyhiptothepointwhereistartedlimpingassoonasigothomeandtookthemoffthepainwasgonetherestoftheeveningimonlybythewaynothingelseinmydailyroutinechangedexceptwearingtheseshoestwodaysinarowidontunderstandwhyitwouldmakemyhiphurtsincetheyarecomfortableonmyfeetbutimsurethatwastheproblemiworedifferentshoestodayandhadnopainidontthinkasmuchasiamonmyfeetiwillbeabletowearthemanextendedamountoftimeiwillhavetorotatewearingthemeveryotherdayfornormalwearibelievepeoplewillbefineiamliterallywalkingorstandingsixhoursadaystraightupdatesoinitiallyafterwearingthemihadhippainafterwearingthemidontknowiftheyjustneededtobebrokeninbutiwearthemallthetimenowandhavenotexperiencedanypainsincethefirstcoupletimesofwearingthemtheyarecomfortableandilovethemevenmorenow

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,favoritetrainingandwalkingaroundsneakerstheylookgoodwithjustaboutanythingandarecomfortableformostsituationswiththeexceptionofrunningforwhichiusepropermizunorunningsneakerswithanarchsupportinsolethesesneakersaremygotoificouldidtakeawayastarforarchsupportihaveaslightlywiderfrontofthefootandarchesthatarealittleonthehighsidesoidolookforagoodunderthefootfiticouldprobablytiethelacesdifferentlyorputinaninsoletheyreprettyexpensivebutasiswhenididazumbaclassinthesemyarchbegantotwingehoweverthisisoverallanawesomeshoethatiwillcontinuetostickwithforgoingoutdaytodaywalkingandfortrainingandgymusewiththeexceptionofrunningandzumbaalthoughhiphopwasfinetheshoeshaveagreatflexibilitytothemanddontlookdirtyeasilymypreviouspairofflexsupremetrshavelastedforagoodyearsandarejustnowonthevergeofbeingwornoutthisistheoptimalsneakerthatisflexibleinmorewaysthanonefrompointingyoutoestolegpressingfromgymusetoshoppingtoaddingasportyedgetoadressynightouttheflexhasitall

I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",Comfortable and lightweight,1462320000,iamarecessaideandonmyfeetalldaylongitriedtheseshoesoninthestorebeforepurchasingthemonamazontheyareverylightweightandcomfortableiwassurprisedhowgreattheyfeltihaventhadapairofnikessincenikeshoxscameouttheyaresomuchmorelightweightthanthoseiworethemanentiredaythefirstdayandhadnoproblemstheseconddayhoweverigotapaininmyhiptothepointwhereistartedlimpingassoonasigothomeandtookthemoffthepainwasgonetherestoftheeveningimonlybythewaynothingelseinmydailyroutinechangedexceptwearingtheseshoestwodaysinarowidontunderstandwhyitwouldmakemyhiphurtsincetheyarecomfortableonmyfeetbutimsurethatwastheproblemiworedifferentshoestodayandhadnopainidontthinkasmuchasiamonmyfeetiwillbeabletowearthemanextendedamountoftimeiwillhavetorotatewearingthemeveryotherdayfornormalwearibelievepeoplewillbefineiamliterallywalkingorstandingsixhoursadaystraightupdatesoinitiallyafterwearingthemihadhippainafterwearingthemidontknowiftheyjustneededtobebrokeninbutiwearthemallthetimenowandhavenotexperiencedanypainsincethefirstcoupletimesofwearingthemtheyarecomfortableandilovethemevenmorenow

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.

Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,favoritetrainingandwalkingaroundsneakerstheylookgoodwithjustaboutanythingandarecomfortableformostsituationswiththeexceptionofrunningforwhichiusepropermizunorunningsneakerswithanarchsupportinsolethesesneakersaremygotoificouldidtakeawayastarforarchsupportihaveaslightlywiderfrontofthefootandarchesthatarealittleonthehighsidesoidolookforagoodunderthefootfiticouldprobablytiethelacesdifferentlyorputinaninsoletheyreprettyexpensivebutasiswhenididazumbaclassinthesemyarchbegantotwingehoweverthisisoverallanawesomeshoethatiwillcontinuetostickwithforgoingoutdaytodaywalkingandfortrainingandgymusewiththeexceptionofrunningandzumbaalthoughhiphopwasfinetheshoeshaveagreatflexibilitytothemanddontlookdirtyeasilymypreviouspairofflexsupremetrshavelastedforagoodyearsandarejustnowonthevergeofbeingwornoutthisistheoptimalsneakerthatisflexibleinmorewaysthanonefrompointingyoutoestolegpressingfromgymusetoshoppingtoaddingasportyedgetoadressynightouttheflexhasitall

The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row.

I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.

Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,favoritetrainingandwalkingaroundsneakerstheylookgoodwithjustaboutanythingandarecomfortableformostsituationswiththeexceptionofrunningforwhichiusepropermizunorunningsneakerswithanarchsupportinsolethesesneakersaremygotoificouldidtakeawayastarforarchsupportihaveaslightlywiderfrontofthefootandarchesthatarealittleonthehighsidesoidolookforagoodunderthefootfiticouldprobablytiethelacesdifferentlyorputinaninsoletheyreprettyexpensivebutasiswhenididazumbaclassinthesemyarchbegantotwingehoweverthisisoverallanawesomeshoethatiwillcontinuetostickwithforgoingoutdaytodaywalkingandfortrainingandgymusewiththeexceptionofrunningandzumbaalthoughhiphopwasfinetheshoeshaveagreatflexibilitytothemanddontlookdirtyeasilymypreviouspairofflexsupremetrshavelastedforagoodyearsandarejustnowonthevergeofbeingwornoutthisistheoptimalsneakerthatisflexibleinmorewaysthanonefrompointingyoutoestolegpressingfromgymusetoshoppingtoaddingasportyedgetoadressynightouttheflexhasitall

Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.

I road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.

I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them.

The size fit perfectly although that being said they are longer on me than the photo (probably my short legs) but came 2 inches above my ankle so just below my calf.  Given that I have weight to loose these are very flattering on as well.  They are also a nice stretchy fabric (thus the comfort) and cool.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.

Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,favoritetrainingandwalkingaroundsneakerstheylookgoodwithjustaboutanythingandarecomfortableformostsituationswiththeexceptionofrunningforwhichiusepropermizunorunningsneakerswithanarchsupportinsolethesesneakersaremygotoificouldidtakeawayastarforarchsupportihaveaslightlywiderfrontofthefootandarchesthatarealittleonthehighsidesoidolookforagoodunderthefootfiticouldprobablytiethelacesdifferentlyorputinaninsoletheyreprettyexpensivebutasiswhenididazumbaclassinthesemyarchbegantotwingehoweverthisisoverallanawesomeshoethatiwillcontinuetostickwithforgoingoutdaytodaywalkingandfortrainingandgymusewiththeexceptionofrunningandzumbaalthoughhiphopwasfinetheshoeshaveagreatflexibilitytothemanddontlookdirtyeasilymypreviouspairofflexsupremetrshavelastedforagoodyearsandarejustnowonthevergeofbeingwornoutthisistheoptimalsneakerthatisflexibleinmorewaysthanonefrompointingyoutoestolegpressingfromgymusetoshoppingtoaddingasportyedgetoadressynightouttheflexhasitall

I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.

Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in.

Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out.

I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.
